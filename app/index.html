      <h2>Drivers Choice</h2>
      <h3>You're paying too much for car insurance. But there's a solution.</h3>
      <p>
      Michigan drivers pay the nation's highest car insurance premiums, averaging $2,400 a year, while nearby states pay less than half that amount.
      </p>
      <p>
      How do we fix it? The solution is Drivers Choice, a plan to cut rates an average 20% to 50% statewide.
      </p>
      <p>
      Michigan drivers are forced to pay for unlimited lifetime health insurance, something no other state in America does.
      </p>
      <p>
      And car insurance companies in Michigan pay outrageous rates for medical treatments like MRIs, CT scans and physical therapy — three to four times as much as private health insurance — because there are no set rates for those treatments.
      </p>
      <p>
      Drivers Choice would give drivers the freedom to choose the level of health coverage they can afford, while still preserving the best levels of coverage in the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
      And it would set fee rates for medical treatments so that car insurance companies get the same discounts bargained for Medicare and private health insurance companies.
      </p>
      <p>
      Tired of paying too much? Find out about Drivers Choice. It's time to fix Michigan's broken no-fault car insurance system. We can't afford not to.

          <h4>Kimberly Weinberger, Roseville</h4>
          <p>She has a clean driving record, good credit, and a good job as a paralegal, so Ms. Weinberger can't understand why she has to pay $1,632 a year to insurer Progressive for the 2016 Ford Escape she leases. When she shopped around for lower rates, other insurers quoted policies at $2,400 to $2,800 a year, so she stuck with her current insurer. She described the other quotes as "out of this world. There was no way I could pay that much. That was more than my car payment."</p>

          <p>Mrs. Williams, 85, a retired registered nurse for the Veterans Administration who lives on Detroit's near east side, doesnt drive as often as she used to and hasn't received a ticket in decades. Still, AAA Michigan quoted her $1,542.74 for a six-month policy for her 2015 Buick Verano in 2017.  "It's a sacrifice, but I do pay it," she says.</p>

      Under the proposed Driver's Choice legislation, Michigan drivers will have more choice in their auto insurance medical coverage that would allow them to save an average of 20% - 50% on their insurance premiums.
